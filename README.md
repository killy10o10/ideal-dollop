# Neighborhood Explorer App

> The _Neighborhood Explorer_ app is a tool that aims to make exploring a new area more convenient and enjoyable. It does this by allowing users to input their interests and location and then generates a list of routes containing various spots, such as cafes, supermarkets, pharmacies, hospitals, bus/tram stops, and more. Users can customize their routes by specifying parameters like the length of the route, modes of transportation, and more.

### Features

Here are the key features of the Neighborhood Explorer app:

#### 1. Route Generation

- Input your interests and location, and the app will generate a list of routes tailored to your preferences.
- Each route includes various spots relevant to your needs and interests.

#### 2. Customizable Routes

- The app allows you to customize routes by specifying parameters such as route length, modes of transportation, and more.
- Users can gamify their experience by completing routes and increasing their "hood familiarity."

#### 3. Gamification (Potential Feature)

- As a potential side implementation, the app may include a gamification element.
- Users can earn "hood familiarity" points for completing routes, and a ranking board could be created to compare familiarity with different neighborhoods, cities, and districts.

### Road to MVP

To bring this application to life, we have outlined the following roadmap:

1. **Data Sources**:

   - Utilize the Google Places API to fetch information about spots (cafes, supermarkets, etc.).
   - Use the Google Maps API for routing and navigation.

2. **Route Generation Algorithm**:

   - Develop an algorithm that picks spots based on user configurations and geographical proximity.

3. **User Experience Enhancement**:

   - Implement user-friendly features for route customization and gamification (if desired).

4. **Data Integration**:
   - Use historical route data to inform the generation of new routes, enhancing the quality of recommendations.
